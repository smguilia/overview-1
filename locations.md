# Locations for resource deployment
{: #locations}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} has a resilient global network of locations to host your highly available cloud workload. You can create resources in different locations but with the same billing and usage view. You can also deploy your apps to the location that is nearest to your customers to achieve low application latency.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} provides 3 tiers of regions: multizone regions (MZR), single-zone regions (SZR), and data centers. For more details, see the following sections.

## Multizone regions
{: #mzr-table}

A [multizone region](#x9774820){: term} (MZR) is composed of 3 or more zones that are independent from each other to ensure that single failure events affect only a single zone. MZRs provide low latency (< 2-milliseconds latency) and high bandwidth (> 1000 Gbps) connectivity across zones. Any [GA](#x2117947){: term} service in an MZR will be available in all MZRs within 90 days.  

The advantage of an MZR is that it provides consistent cloud services across different zones, better resiliency, availability, higher interconnect speed between data centers for your resources. These features can be critical to your applications. Deploying the application in an MZR rather than an SZR can increase the availability from 99.9% to 99.99% when deployed over 3 zones. 

The following table lists the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} MZRs and the region, zone, and data center codes for each one.

Osaka is a single-site MZR. In a single-site MZR, the three data centers that support the three zones are running in the same building. The underlying infrastructure in the Osaka MZR zone has the same SLA as other individual zones in a multi-site MZR. Osaka MZR resiliency to failures in local city and location infrastructures is reduced because of being located in a single building. 
{: note}

## Single-zone regions
{: #szr-table}

You can also choose to deploy resources to an SZR, but you can't spread them across zones. The following table lists the [SZRs](#x9774825){: term} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and the region, zone, and data center codes for each one.

| Location      | Region   | Zone | Data Center |
|-----------|----------|------|----|
| Seoul     | kr-seo | kr-seo-1 | SEO01 |
| Chennai | in-che-1  |in-che-1  | CHE01 |
{: caption="Table 2. SZRs for creating resources" caption-side="top"}

## Data centers
{: #data-centers}

In addition to selecting a region for your resource, you can select from a list of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} [data centers](#x2439906){: term}. Data centers host the power, cooling, compute, network, and storage resources used for services and apps. They don't provide isolation from multizones in a location. 

Data centers are based on a POD architecture where each data center can have more than one POD, depending on on-demand buildout. Each POD consists of racks, servers, networks, and storage, along with backup power generators. Placing application servers across PODs further improves the availability.

See [Global locations for your global business](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/data-centers/){: external} for an interactive map showing the available data centers, MZRs, Network PoP, and federal data centers.

## Viewing resources by location
{: #filter-location}

You can view all resources and locations from the Resource list page in the console. If you want to view and work with resources in a specific location, expand the **Location** filter, and select a location from the list. By expanding a specific location, you can select to filter by individual data centers, regions, or zones.

For example, if you have resources that are deployed in the London 2 (eu-gb-2) zone, you can set filters to display only those resources in your resource list. Expand the **London** metro option, and the **London (eu-gb)** region option. Within that region, you can select from the list of available zones. If you have a resource that is deployed in a specific data center, you can identify the data center by the specific metro location and alphanumeric code. For example, **Dallas** for the metro location and then **Dallas 07 (dal07)** for the data center.

You might also want to display your resources that are located globally. The **Global** option means that only one logical, globally accessible instance of the service, independent of any region or zone, is published to customer applications. These types of resources are accessible from a global endpoint.

As illustrated in the following graphic, a data center is a physical building that represents an availability zone that is located within a multizone region (MZR). An MZR is organized by its metro location. For example, London can encompass more than one grouping of data centers within an MZR. The graphic shows three availability zones in one MZR that work together in the instance that one of the data centers becomes unavailable. Availability zones are connected directly to each or through low latency links.
