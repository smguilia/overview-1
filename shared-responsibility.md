# Shared responsibilities for using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} products
{: #shared-responsibilities}

In {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}, as is the case for other cloud service providers, the responsibilities for managing the lifecycle of, operating, and securing products are shared between {{site.data.keyword.IBM}} and the customer.

The responsibility of completing the following types of tasks on various products can be exclusive to {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, the customer, or shared between the two. The tasks for each type of product are grouped in the following categories:

* Incident and operations management: Includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery.
* Change management: Includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion.
* Identity and access management: Includes tasks such as authentication, authorization, access control policies, and approving, granting, and revoking access.
* Security and regulation compliance: Includes tasks such as security controls implementation and compliance certification.
* Disaster recovery: Includes tasks such as providing dependencies on disaster recovery sites, provision disaster recovery environments, data and configuration backup, replicating data and configuration to the disaster recovery environment, and failover on disaster events.


When you're reviewing the following sections, the tables list resources for each category and who manages them. The following list describes what constitutes each type of resource in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} supports the following types of products and the corresponding shared responsibility models. For more information about each specific service, see the documentation for that service.

## Infrastructure-as-a-service 
{: #iaas-services-responsibilities}

Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) products that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} are multi-tenant, accessed remotely, hosted on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} physical infrastructure, created in customer-owned accounts, and have control plane and data plane security that is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Examples of this product type are Virtual Servers and Bare Metal Servers with the related block volumes that are connected to the customer account private subnets. You can find a list of these types of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog on the Services tab. Each product is in an infrastructure subcategory within the Compute or VPC infrastructure categories.

## Managed products
{: #managed-responsibilities}

Products that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} require customer responsibilities only for the data or applications that customers add to the service. They are multi-tenant, accessed remotely, hosted on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} virtual resources, created in {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}-owned accounts, and have control plane and data plane security that is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. Examples of this product type are {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} databases or {{site.data.keyword.cloudant_short_notm}} database instances. You can find a list of these types of products in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog on the Services tab. However, any products that are listed in an infrastructure subcategory are infrastructure-as-a-service type products.

## Software packages

Software packages are deployed by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} as single tenant instances, and they are accessed locally in the customer account. The software instance is hosted on resources in the customer's accounts. The software deployment control plane security is owned by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, and the software instance security is owned by the customer.

A generic software deployment control plane manages the lifecycle of deployed software package instances. At a minimum, it manages the deployment, upgrade, and delete actions. As the packages become smarter, the generic control plane might also manage the start, stop, migration, scaling, monitoring, backup, and restore tasks.

You can find a list of software in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog on the Software tab.
