# Managing security and compliance in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}
{: #manage-security-compliance}

With the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you can manage the security and compliance of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} platform.
{: shortdesc}

In the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you can accomplish the following tasks:

* Monitor for controls and goals that pertain to platform services.
* Define rules that can help to standardize resource configuration.

## Monitoring security and compliance posture
{: #monitor-platform}

As a security or compliance focal, you can use [goals](#x2117978){: term} of specific platform services to help ensure that your organization is adhering to the external and internal standards for your industry. By using the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to validate the resource configurations in your account against a [profile](#x2034950){: term}, you can identify potential issues as they arise.

All of the goals for the platform are added to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Best Practices Controls 1.0 profile but can also be mapped to other profiles.
{: note}

To start monitoring your resources, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic-security-compliance-getting-started).

## Governing resource configuration for platform services
{: #govern-platform}

As a security or compliance focal, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to define configuration rules for the platform services that you're working with in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. 

[Config rules](#x3084914){: term} are used to enforce the configuration standards that you want to implement across your accounts. For more details about the data that you can use to create a rule, review the following table.

| Billing | `account-trait` | `hipaa_accepted` | Boolean |  Indicates whether the account has the `hipaa_accepted` flag enabled. |
| Catalog Management | `account-settings` | `allow_ibm_provider_only` | Boolean |  Indicates whether users are restricted to installing only software provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Set catalog management filters to comply with this rule. This rule cannot be combined with other provider rules. |
| Catalog Management | `account-settings` | `allow_ibm_provider` | Boolean |  Indicates whether users can install software provided by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} software from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog. Set catalog management filters to comply with this rule. |
| Catalog Management | `account-settings` | `allow_community_provider` | Boolean |  Indicates whether users can install community-provided software from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog.  Set catalog management filters to comply with this rule. |
