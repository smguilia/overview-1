## Delivering notifications by using webhooks
{: #deliver-notification-webhook}

New as of: 21 April 2021

You can now easily add webhooks to the notification distribution list in addition to adding email addresses. You can register a webhook with your account on the [Notification distribution list page](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/notifications-distribution-list) to receive all account notifications. Administrators can use webhooks to configure an application to receive asynchronous notifications whenever an event occurs on the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform. Any registered webhook must support HTTP POST requests and accept the notification as a JSON.

For more information, see [Setting email preferences for notifications](/docs/account?topic=account-email-prefs#adding-webhooks-to-a-distribution-list).

## Upcoming changes to the user invitation flow
{: #upcoming-invitation-flow}

New as of: 19 April 2021

From June 1, 2021, to enhance security and user protection, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} will require all users to accept an invitation in order to become an active user within a new account. The new invitation flow will have an impact only on inviting existing {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} users. Existing users are currently being automatically onboarded to each new account as they are invited. After this change, these users will need to accept an invitation in their notifications, by email, or by using the CLI to onboard to a new account.

Concerned about how this change will impact your automation? To avoid any disruption to on-going workflows, you need to check your scripts:

* To accept invitations in the CLI, existing members of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} must use the [**`ibmcloud login`**](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_cli#accept-invitation-to-join-a-new-account-) command. They need to target the account that they are invited to join and use the new `--accept` flag.

As an account administrator, you may want to remind your users to accept these invitations upon initial change of this behavior.

Because these workloads are all hosted within the same Kubernetes infrastructure, all of them can seamlessly work together. The {{site.data.keyword.codeengineshort}} experience is designed so that you can focus on writing code and not on the infrastructure that is needed to host it.


## Managing user login sessions
{: #user-session-settings}

## Term-based model for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support subscriptions
{: #support-subscriptions}
New as of: 23 September 2019

New subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} support now follow the same term-based model as subscriptions for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform services. Rather than credit being valid in monthly increments, credit is now available up front for an entire subscription term, which can be up to one year's worth of credit. You now have more flexibility to use your support credit when you need it, and the chances of incurring monthly overages are reduced. When you buy or renew a support subscription, any existing active support subscriptions are converted to this new flexible model for the remainder of their term. For more information, see [Support subscriptions](/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#support-subscriptions).

You can also now view your support subscriptions in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console so you can keep track of your available credit. For more information, see [Viewing your support costs](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-support).

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprises for centrally managing multiple accounts
{: #ibm-cloud-enterprises}
New as of: 25 July 2019

You can now centrally manage billing and usage for multiple accounts by creating an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} enterprise. With an enterprise, you can create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts by organizing related accounts into account groups. Enterprises simplify management of multiple accounts with the following key features:
   * Consolidated billing means that you can manage billing, invoicing, and payment for all accounts from a single place, the enterprise account. 
   * Subscription credit is aggregated into a credit pool and shared with all accounts in the enterprise. Not only is tracking your subscriptions easier, but you can get fewer, larger subscriptions for a better discount because the credit is shared. 
   * Top-down usage reporting gives you a unified view of usage costs from all accounts, organized according to your enterprise hierarchy. 

If you have multiple accounts, at least one of which is a Subscription account, you can create an enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise) and [Introducing IBM Cloud Enterprises](http://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/Introducing-IBM-Cloud-Enterprises){: external}  for more information.

## Subscriptions page for tracking subscription credit spending
{: #subscriptions-page}
New as of: 18 July 2019

If you have a Subscription account, you can now view all of your subscriptions and analyze your credit spending on the Subscriptions page. You get a high-level view of the total subscription credit in your account and detailed charts that visualize trends such as your credit burndown and monthly spending. You can also view credit from any promotions in your account. For more information, see [Managing subscriptions](/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-subscriptions).

Additionally, to better reflect their usage, codes that you apply to add subscription credit to your account are now called subscription codes rather than feature codes.

This new access group is called the `Public access` group, and all users and service IDs are added to it by default. You can update the policies for the access group to enable all users, even unauthenticated users, access to the resource that you specify in the policy. [Learn more about the public access group](/docs/account?topic=account-public#public).

## Multifactor authentication for users with federated IDs
New as of: 12 March 2019
{: #mfa-federated}

Account owners or users assigned the administrator role for the billing account management service can enable multifcator authentication (MFA) for all users in their account. Federated users who use their corporate or enterprise single sign-on ID can now be required to authenticate by using MFA for logging in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. For more information about this feature enhancement and what you need to know about enabling MFA for your account, see [Introducing MFA for IBM Cloud Users with Federated ID](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-mfa-for-ibm-cloud-users-with-federated-id){: external} .

## Unified login, API keys, and user and access management
New as of: 30 November 2018
{: #useraccess}

With our latest updates, you can take advantage of a simplified secure login that is available for all users regardless of your ID type. Whether you have an IBMid or a SoftLayer ID, you can quickly log in to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console from our enhanced login page. You can also make secure API calls across {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and automate your CLI login by using an IAM API key or an IAM access token. 

After you log in, you can now see all users, including platform and classic infrastructure users, from your Users page in the Access (IAM) UI. Depending on your access to view other users in the account, you can filter your view quickly by account users, classic infrastructure users, or Cloud Foundry org. You can also use the filters to find users quickly by name, email, or status.

Now that all of your users are in a single console, you can manage their access to all types of resources from the same place. Access starts with the user, so start by selecting a user from your list. Then, depending on which type of resource that you want to assign access to, you can choose from IAM access policies, Cloud Foundry access, or classic infrastructure permissions. If you want to assign IAM access policies, try creating an access group to streamline your access management process by adding all users to the same access group that need the same policies assigned.

New as of: 30 November 2018
{: #tag}

Tags are now available for you to add to your resources, like Cloud Object Storage, to help you manage resources and find the resources that are the most relevant to you. For example, if you have hundreds of resources and you want to differentiate between ones that are paid the same way, you could tag them with `costcenter:location01`. Or, if you have a team that is working on a couple of resources repeatedly, you can use something like `team-blue`. You can also filter the My resources page by tags to quickly organize and find the resources that you need. For more information, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag) and [Platform Tagging on the Enhanced {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Platform](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/platform-tagging-on-the-enhanced-ibm-cloud-platform){: external} .

## Updated global location names
New as of: 1 November 2018
{: #location-name-updates}

As {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} continues to expand our global availability footprint, we’re updating our location naming structure to better support an understandable, consistent hierarchy of geographies, regions, and data centers around the world. If you’re familiar with our current global regions, you’ll recognize names like US South and Sydney. We’re aligning these location names to the names of the city in which the data centers physically exist.

For now, the programmatic IDs are not changing, so there’s no impact from an API perspective. The following table shows the old and new location names. For more information and a comprehensive list of data centers and regions, see [Service availability](/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region).

| Previous Location Display Name | New Location Display Name | Code     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|

## Assign account management access to others
New as of: 30 October 2018
{: #acct-mgmt-services}

With {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can delegate common tasks that you complete as an account administrator to another user in your account. By creating an access policy on one or all of the available account management services, you can easily delegate responsibilities such as inviting and removing users, managing access groups, managing service IDs, maintaining private catalog services, and even monitoring billing and tracking usage. There are four individual account management services and an all services option that you can use to set up access policies:

* User Management for inviting and removing users
* IAM Access Groups for creating, editing, deleting, updating, and assigning access 
* IAM Identity Service for viewing, creating, deleting, and assigning access to service IDs and associated API keys across the account
* Global resource catalog for viewing private catalog offerings and updating the metadata and visibility for the offerings
* All account management services for access to each of the individual account management service options based on the assigned role as well as access to billing and usage tracking.

For more information on the tasks that a user can do based on which account management service they have a policy on and which role they are assigned, see [Example platform management roles and actions for account management services](/docs/account?topic=account-account-services#account-management-actions-roles). For more information about this new feature, see the [Introducing More Flexibility and Control for IBM Cloud Account Management Services Access](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/introducing-more-flexibility-and-control-for-ibm-cloud-account-management-services-access){: external}  blog post.

## Dynamically add federated users to access groups
New as of: 12 July 2018
{: #add-fed-users}

You can create dynamic rules to automatically add federated users to access groups based on specific identity attributes. When your users log in with a federated ID, the data from the identity provider dynamically maps your users to an access group based on the rules that you set. For more information, see [Creating dynamic rules for access groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rules).

## Protect your service IDs and API keys
New as of: 1 June 2018
{: #protect-svcid-apikey}

To avoid a situation where your service ID or API key is deleted causing an outage or disruption, you can lock service IDs and API keys by using the UI or CLI. Locking a service ID also prevents any access policies from being changed, deleted, or assigned as well as any API keys associated with the service ID from being created or deleted. For more information, see [Locking a service ID](/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys#lockkey) and [Locking an API key](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey).

## Upgrade your Lite account to a Subscription account

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI rebranding
New as of: 15 May 2018
{: #cli-rebrand}

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CLI commands changed from **`bluemix`** and **`bx`** to **`ibmcloud`**. However, you can still use the **`bluemix`** and **`bx`** CLI commands until they are removed later. There is no short name now, just the full name **`ibmcloud`**. 

## Multi-factor authentication for your account
New as of: 02 May 2018
{: #account-mfa}

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring all users to provide a time-based one-time passcode in addition to their standard IBMid and password during login. This is also commonly known as two-factor authentication (2FA). MFA is enabled per account, and once it is turned on, all users in the account are required to log in by using the extra security measure. For more information, see the [IBM Cloud Platform now adds support for Multi-Factor Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ibm-cloud-platform-now-adds-support-multi-factor-authentication){: external}  blog post.

## Assign access quickly by using access groups
New as of: 03 April 2018
{: #access-groups}

Do you want to be able to assign access quickly by using the least number of policies possible? Now you can with access groups. Group a set of users and service IDs together and assign a single policy that applies to all members of the group.

On 1 March 2018 {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} will withdraw support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 across many of our cloud products and services as part of our commitment to offering a cloud that is secure to the core and in alignment with industry best practices for security and data privacy.

## A new way to organize resources within your account
New as of: 16 November 2017
{: #usergs}

Resource groups are a new way for you to create customizable groupings of account resources, and access to the group and the resources within it are managed by using Identity and Access Management (IAM). Everyone starts out with a default resource group. You can rename this resource group and add new service instances to it as you create them from the catalog.

For users with a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, you can create extra resource groups to make managing quota and viewing billing usage for a set of resources easier. You can also group resources to make it easier for you to assign users access to more than one service at a time. To learn more about working with resource groups for your account, see [Managing resource groups](/docs/account?topic=account-rgs).

## Updates for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} IAM
New as of: 16 November 2017
{: #iam-nov17}

The introduction of resource groups within your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account provides a new way for you to assign access. Users and service IDs can be assigned access to all services within a resource group, enabling you to quickly assign access to more than one resource at a time. You can also customize access for each user or service ID by assigning access to just some services within a resource group, or you choose to assign access to individual resources down to the service instance level. For more information about the features that you can take advantage of by using IAM, see [What features does IAM provide?](/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview#features)

## Customize your dashboard view

## Identity and Access Management application authentication feature
New as of: 6 October 2017
{: #app-authfeature}

Identity and Access Management (IAM) now supports service IDs, which you can think of as identities that can be used for apps to authenticate with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services. Instead of using individual user credentials, a Service ID can be created with an associated API key and access permissions in the form of a service policy that is assigned to the Service ID in order for you to control the level of access for any application authenticating with that ID.

For more information about the benefits of this feature and how to get started, see the [Introducing IBM Cloud IAM Service IDs and API Keys](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/introducing-ibm-cloud-iam-service-ids-api-keys){: external} .

## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} global catalog
New as of: 27 July 2017
{: #gc}

Expanding on the last console update to manage your public regions from a single location in the console, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} now has a global catalog, making the process of selecting and deploying items that you select from the catalog a more streamlined process. Regardless of the region that you select in the console, you can now see all services that are available across all public regions from your catalog. Once you select a tile from the catalog, you can see which regions the service is available in, and select where you want to deploy it. For more information about the latest updates to the catalog, see [A global {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog makes building things easier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/global-bluemix-catalog-makes-building-things-easier){: external} .

## Identity and access management
New as of: 01 May 2017
{: #iam-may17}

With the latest updates and improvements, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account owners or administrators can now use a new unified access control UI to take advantage of the following capabilities:
 * Manage users' fine-grained access to Kubernetes services and other services as they adopt the new access control features
 * Assign service policies and Cloud Foundry roles to users within their organizations

Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform users can create, delete, and list API keys associated with their user IDs. And platform users can use those API keys to authenticate when using APIs or CLIs.

Lastly, we enhanced our unified user management capability to ensure that in a linked IaaS-PaaS account, users are managed in a unified way with no need to add users separately in the SoftLayer Customer Portal or the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console.
